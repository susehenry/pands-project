    "Python language is one of the most trending programming languages as it is more dynamic than others. Python is a simple high-level and an open-source language used for general-purpose programming. For this project, I will be using Python 3 and a selection of libraries for data analysis and manipulation of the iris dataset and demonstrating how to use it in practice.\n",

    "The Iris flower data set or Fishers data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature, and is frequently referenced to this day.\n",
    "The iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\n",

    "•\tMax value?\n",
