# Python –Using the Iris Dataset 


Python language is one of the most trending programming languages as it is more dynamic than others. Python is a simple high-level and an open-source language used for general-purpose programming. For this project, I will be using Python 3 and a selection of libraries for data analysis and manipulation of the iris dataset and demonstrating how to use it in practice.

This article is written using Juypter notebooks,the notebook combines two components:

A web application: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.

Notebook documents: a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.  

The Iris flower data set or Fishers data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature, and is frequently referenced to this day.
The iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes:
1.	sepal length in cm
2.	sepal width in cm
3.	petal length in cm
4.	petal width in cm
5.	species:
o	Iris Versicolour
o	Iris Setosa
o	Iris Virginica


# Python Libraries
Python 3 has many open-source libraries, in Anaconda 3 I can use the command conda list to show me the available libraries, from this list of libraries I will be using pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008. 
Why Use Pandas?
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Relevant data is very important in data science.
What Can Pandas Do?
Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:
•	Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
•	What is average value?
•	Max value?
•	Min value?
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.
